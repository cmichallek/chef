# /etc/hosts.allow: list of hosts that are allowed to access the system.
#                   See the manual pages hosts_access(5) and hosts_options(5).
#
# Example:    ALL: LOCAL @some_netgroup
#             ALL: .foobar.edu EXCEPT terminalserver.foobar.edu
#
# If you're going to protect the portmapper use the name "portmap" for the
# daemon name. Remember that you can only use the keyword "ALL" and IP
# addresses (NOT host or domain names) for the portmapper, as well as for
# rpc.mountd (the NFS mount daemon). See portmap(8) and rpc.mountd(8)
# for further information.
#

### I approve of FreeBSD's Policy. ###
#
# NOTE: The hosts.deny file is deprecated.
#       Place both 'allow' and 'deny' rules in the hosts.allow file.
#	See hosts_options(5) for the format of this file.
#	hosts_access(5) no longer fully applies.

# Start by allowing everything (this prevents the rest of the file
# from working, so remove it when you need protection).
# The rules here work on a "First match wins" basis.
#ALL : ALL : allow

# Wrapping sshd(8) is not normally a good idea, but if you
# need to do it, here's how
<% @allowhosts.each do |host| -%>
sshd : <%= host %> : allow
<% end %>
sshd : localhost 127.0.0.1 : allow
sshd : <%= node['fqdn'] %> <%= node['ipaddress'] %> : allow
sshd : ALL : deny

# Protect against simple DNS spoofing attacks by checking that the
# forward and reverse records for the remote host match. If a mismatch
# occurs, access is denied, and any positive ident response within
# 20 seconds is logged. No protection is afforded against DNS poisoning,
# IP spoofing or more complicated attacks. Hosts with no reverse DNS
# pass this rule.
#ALL : PARANOID : RFC931 20 : deny
 
# Allow anything from localhost.  Note that an IP address (not a host
# name) *MUST* be specified for rpcbind(8).
ALL : localhost 127.0.0.1 : allow
# Comment out next line if you build libwrap without IPv6 support.
ALL : [::1] : allow
ALL : <%= node['fqdn'] %> <%= node['ipaddress'] %> : allow

# Exim is an alternative to sendmail, available in the ports tree
exim : localhost : allow
#exim : .nice.guy.example.com : allow
#exim : .evil.cracker.example.com : deny
exim : ALL : allow

# Rpcbind is used for all RPC services; protect your NFS!
# (IP addresses rather than hostnames *MUST* be used here)
#rpcbind : 192.0.2.32/255.255.255.224 : allow
#rpcbind : 192.0.2.96/255.255.255.224 : allow
rpcbind : ALL : deny
portmap : ALL : deny
